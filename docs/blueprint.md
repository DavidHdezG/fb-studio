## Core Features:

- Dynamic Hero Section: Integrate a parallax scrolling effect to showcase various services and products offered by Bifrost Code. As users scroll, featured content slides in and out of view.

- Interactive 3D Cards: Feature key values or team members within 3D cards. These cards respond to mouse movements, offering a pseudo-3D effect that enhances user engagement and provides more in-depth information.
- Animated Contact Form: Implement an animated contact form with smooth transitions and interactive elements. Animations highlight input fields and the submit button upon focus and interaction.

## Style Guidelines:

- Accent color: Light gray (#F1F5F9) to add subtle contrast without overwhelming the dark background. This can be used for secondary text or less prominent UI elements.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk' sans-serif for bold headings, lending a tech-centric, futuristic feel.
- Body font: 'Inter' sans-serif for body text, to provide excellent readability and a clean, modern aesthetic.
- Parallax scrolling effect in the hero section for a dynamic, immersive user experience.
- Subtle slide-in animations for partner logos in the clients section to create visual interest.
- Animated gradients on buttons and interactive elements to subtly draw attention and reinforce interactivity.
